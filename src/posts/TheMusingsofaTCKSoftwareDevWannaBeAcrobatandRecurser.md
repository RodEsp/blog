Hello, world!

If you're reading this, I can only assume you're here on purpose, so thanks for taking some time to check out my disorganized ramblings.

Recently, I joined the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a retreat for curious programmers, which has given me the opportunity to focus on personal growth and explore my interests more deeply. This exciting new chapter in my life has inspired me to start this blog, where I'll delve into a wide array of topics that pique my interest â€“ including but not limited to writing software, the joys of movement, outdoor adventures, the natural world, people, physics, health, data, diving, gymnastics, ..., and whatever else happens to distract my "Oh look over there, shiny!" brain.

While I'm here at the Recurse Center, I'll be engaging with a supportive community of like-minded individuals, and hopefully learning from their diverse backgrounds and experiences. This incredible opportunity has already shown me the value of journaling as a way to [learn in public](https://www.learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf) and organize my thoughts. Which is partly what is motivating this blog.

As I explore these concepts, I'd love to hear your insights, experiences, and perspectives. My writing will be fueled by curiosity, empathy, the desire to make a positive impact on the world around me. I hope that my musings will provoke thought, spark discussion, and contribute to your own personal growth, even if just a tiny bit.

Stay tuned!

\- Rodrigo
