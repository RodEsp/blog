So I started \"re-writing\" my GLSL into HLSL, but at this point, I was so tired that what I actually did was just randomly mess about with the GLSL shader I had. I was constantly running `cargo run` to make sure that I didn't have any glaring errors in my shader code and to my great surprise, one of those times, everything just worked! There were no errors, and this ray-traced sphere popped up on my screen!"

It took careful backstepping through my changes to realize that I had removed the `rbga8` part of the layout declaration. And I only found this because I thought, \"Oh, I'm missing the image format here. Better add it back\", which instantly gave me the error I experienced at the beginning of this odyssey. Only then did I realize that you don't have to specify an image format for Vulkan Compute Shaders (and possibly other shaders?). This is probably fundamental knowledge (or I'm pigeon-holing myself into a horrible unfixable situation later on when I need an image format to do something in the shader. If so, someone, please yell at me to let me know.) But if not, I hope this blog helps someone else going forward when they desperately google how to enable more image formats for their GPU."
